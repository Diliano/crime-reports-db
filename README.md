# Building a Database for Crime Reports in Boston

This project demonstrates creating a PostgreSQL database (`crime_db`) to manage Boston crime data. The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that details the entire process, from database creation to data import and role-based access control.

## Key Steps
- Design a schema and create the `boston_crimes` table.
- Import data from `boston.csv`.
- Set up user roles (`readonly` and `readwrite`) with appropriate privileges.
- Assign users (`data_analyst` and `data_scientist`) to these roles.

## How to Explore
Check out the notebook in this repository for:
- The step-by-step implementation.
- SQL queries for testing privileges and roles.
- Insights into the data and database design.
